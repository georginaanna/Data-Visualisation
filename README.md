# Data-Visualisation

This project is part of the assessment for the module C7083 Data Visualisation and Analytics, that is ran at Harper Adams University College by Ed Harris and Joe Roberts for the MSc Course: Data Science for Global Agriculture, Food and Environment. 

The aim is top provide exactly four data visulisations for each data set. 

We have been allocated three data sets from the tidy tuesday github, this are shown below with the link to view:
