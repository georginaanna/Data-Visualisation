# Data-Visualisation

This project is part of the assessment for the module C7083 Data Visualisation and Analytics, that is ran at Harper Adams University College by Ed Harris and Joe Roberts for the MSc Course: Data Science for Global Agriculture, Food and Environment. 

The aim is top provide exactly four data visulisations for each data set. These visualisations must have a clear narrative for the data and not simply be descriptive. A short introduction to the data that details their content, origin, compiler, etc. is required to provide context. Data sets must be treated as unique and contain a base R, a ggplot and an interactive visualisation. The final visualisation for each data set can be created by any method, including those not using R. 

We have been allocated three data sets from the tidy tuesday github, this are shown below with the link to view:

1.Global Crop Yields	Tidy Tuesday	https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-09-01
